# Autonomous Satellite Management Solution

This repository contains the source code and documentation for our cutting-edge *Autonomous Satellite Management Solution*.

## Core Functionalities

- *Self-Driving Satellites*: Our solution enables satellites to autonomously avoid space debris and relocate when necessary, ensuring safe operations.
- *Collision Avoidance*: By leveraging real-time data, our solution prevents satellite collisions, enhancing space safety.
- *Automatic Launch Coordination*: Simplifies satellite deployment with minimal ground intervention, making the process more efficient and reliable.

## Technology Used

- Integration with *real-time TLE (Two-Line Element)* data for satellite position tracking.
- *SGP-4 orbital trajectory calculation* for accurate orbital predictions.
- Proprietary algorithms designed for *route optimization* and ensuring safe travel paths for satellites.
- Utilized [`react-globe.gl`](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-globe.gl) to create an interactive 3D globe visualization with customizable markers, labels, and animations for geographic data representation.
